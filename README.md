# ansible-ubuntu-workstation
This configures my ubuntu workstation. I started this for my home system. Basically I wanted to extend the idea of dotfiles being stored in git. This allows me to get all of the tools I like on any ubuntu system and to configure the terminal to work the way I want.


## Todo
- Clean up the code and add some comments
- Break up the main file in the localhost role so that it has better logical seperation of ideas
